# RapidGamesPrototyping

## Marble Madness
This prototype was tasked to be a marble rolling game where you have to reach the goal at the end of each level, whilst avoiding the obstacles. Given the overall
framework, this was a good way for me to learn a few of the basics of Unity, such as movement of a rigidbody through physics, and their interactions with other 
objects in the game world through the use of colliders. One aspect which I tried to create, but struggled to complete, was having the level reset when the player's 
marble rolls off the edge. In order to do this, I ended up manually resetting certain aspects where needed, for example reverting the marble's colour (used to open
corresponding coloured doors) to the original blue colour and placing the player back at the spawn point, whilst keeping other aspects, such as time remaining, the same.
If I had more time on this project, I would likely want to add additional levels, and potentially features such as platforms with different properties (e.g. falling,
invisible, sticky, etc.)

## Side Scroller
In this prototype, I was required to make a 2D shooter which scrolls a screen over time, whether horizontally or vertically. With this being my first 2D game in Unity,
it allowed me to learn alot in terms of animation for sprites. Through animation, I also learned how to add event markers for code to be ran, for example calling
a function on a given frame. I also learned alot about the user interface with this prototype, through the creation of health bars and a score variable which is shown to
the player. One issue I ran into when making this game was making it an infinite scroller, but I was taught how to fix it, by essentially splitting the background and
putting it into a list, then moving the backgrounds as necessary and rotating their list position to make an infinite loop.If I had more time to complete this project, I
would like to add additional enemies, such as bosses or those which have different methods of hurting the player (e.g. different movement, shooting projectiles, etc.)
to make the game more engaging.
